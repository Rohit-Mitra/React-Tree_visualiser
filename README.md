Design a visual tree-structure renderer that displays hierarchical data with clean spacing, clear
parent-child relationships, and intuitive interactions. The visualizer should render nodes without
overlap, center parents above children, and support expansion/collapse of subtrees.
Use React Flow.
Core Features
The visualizer must include:
1. Proper tree layout with calculated spacing between siblings
2. Parent node centered above its entire group of children
3. Edges connecting parent and child nodes
4. Expand/Collapse functionality for any node with children
5. Smooth recalculation of layout when collapsing or expanding
